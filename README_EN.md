- **Batch Issue Indexing** — Vector cache refresh + AI metadata enrichment
- **Health Check Endpoint** — `/health` + Docker Compose auto health detection
- **Unified Authentication** — GitHub OAuth (`user:email`, preferring the verified primary email) and Passkeys share the internal user ID; Telegram never determines login or permissions
- **Optional Notification Channels** — Telegram and Email/SMTP can be enabled independently; Personal Settings supports one-time Telegram bind/unbind. Announcement notifications render Markdown on both channels, show the announcement type with a bold title, and the email sender display name is configurable (defaults to Sakura-AI)
- **Announcement Center** — Super admins can save and publish in one step, including editing a published announcement into a new send round; users can track unread/read/all-read state, while version-guarded broadcasts retain historical content and delivery outcomes
- **GitHub OAuth Login** — Direct signup/login without requiring Telegram configuration

### Upgrade and Compatibility

- **Upgrading from 3.1.3 to 3.2.0**: Old data is migrated automatically and idempotently on the first startup after the upgrade — no manual steps. New tables (announcements, notification deliveries, notification endpoints, external identities) are created automatically; legacy `telegram_users` Telegram IDs, GitHub usernames, and emails are backfilled as described in the next bullet; existing user IDs, roles, quotas, business data, and foreign keys are untouched. Email/SMTP notifications are new in 3.2.0 (3.1.3 has no mail settings): to enable them, fill in the SMTP fields on the System Core Config page — choose "SSL/TLS (implicit TLS)" for port 465 or "STARTTLS" for port 587; the sender display name defaults to Sakura-AI. Legacy field names in imported config backups are mapped automatically (e.g. the boolean `smtp_tls` becomes a security mode).
- On first startup, legacy `telegram_users` identity data is migrated idempotently: original user IDs, roles, quotas, business data, and foreign keys are preserved while Telegram IDs and GitHub usernames are backfilled as notification endpoints and external identities. For a Telegram-only account, an administrator should assign its GitHub username in the user page before the user signs in with OAuth to claim the existing account.
- User backups v1/v2 are accepted with automatic legacy-field mapping; new backups include identities, notification endpoints, and email. Config restore never overwrites deployment connection settings, and SMTP passwords remain redacted as sensitive values.

## Quick Start

### Online Demo (Fastest)

### Docker One-Click Deployment (Recommended for Self-hosting)

**Linux full deployment** (Web + MySQL + Redis + Host Updater + Agent sandboxd):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sakura520222/Sakura-AI/main/start.sh | sudo bash -s -- --prod
```

This deploys the **stable channel** by default. To deploy the **development channel** (latest builds from the develop branch) from the very first deployment:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sakura520222/Sakura-AI/main/start.sh | sudo bash -s -- --channel=development --prod
```

The interactive menu's production deployment also asks for the channel on first setup; switch channels later via the menu's channel switch entry.

`start.sh` runs from any location or pipe: the first execution installs itself into `/opt/sakura-ai` (override with `SAKURA_INSTALL_ROOT`) and downloads the production compose file for the selected image channel (stable from `main`, development from `develop`; override the distribution source with `SAKURA_DIST_BASE_URL`); all later management stays in `/opt/sakura-ai` via `sudo ./start.sh`.

`sudo ./start.sh --prod` creates deployment state, resolves immutable Web, sandboxd, and Agent runner image references for the current Release, starts and verifies the independent sandboxd first, then starts Web/MySQL/Redis and installs the Host Updater. Only sandboxd receives the Docker socket; neither Web nor one-shot runners do. Pressing `Ctrl+C` only detaches the progress view. Releases are checked automatically but require administrator confirmation. Stable updates use one three-image transaction for preflight, pulls, sidecar replacement, Web activation, and rollback; an unavailable Updater never falls back to a Web-only update. macOS, Windows, and container-only deployments do not provide this Linux OS sandbox or Host Updater; see the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

> **Synchronizing Host Updater after a WebUI update:** A stable WebUI update transaction updates Web, sandboxd, and the Agent runner together, but it does not replace the currently running Host Updater binary. After the update succeeds and `/health` reports the new version, run the following command in `/opt/sakura-ai` to align the Updater binary with that Release:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ./start.sh updater reinstall
> ```
>
> `reinstall` first uses the updater's internal lock to atomically close new submissions and prove that no job is active, then stops, installs, starts, and reports the new daemon state; if installation fails, it attempts to restore the existing daemon. If an older updater does not support the atomic maintenance gate, the command fails closed and requires the administrator to stop that legacy daemon explicitly first. The installer selects a concrete Sakura AI Release from deployment state, but it does not enforce application health. Treat a successful `/health` response containing the expected new version as a mandatory manual prerequisite; do not continue if the health check fails, is unavailable, or reports a different version. See the [Host Updater section of the Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#webui-更新后同步-host-updater) for complete verification steps.

Uninstall has two levels. The standard uninstall preserves Docker data volumes for a later redeployment; explicit `--purge` removes the volumes, all images (Web/MySQL/Redis/sandboxd/Agent runner), and deployment files. In a standalone install such as `/opt/sakura-ai`, full uninstall leaves only `start.sh` for a clean redeployment; source repository files are protected. Both modes share the single `UNINSTALL` confirmation word:

```bash
sudo ./start.sh uninstall          # Standard uninstall: preserve data for a later redeployment
sudo ./start.sh uninstall --purge  # Full uninstall: delete data/images; keep only start.sh in a standalone install
```

**Web image only** (bring your own MySQL/Redis):

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=mysql+asyncmy://user:pass@host:3306/sakura_ai \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379/0 \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  ghcr.io/sakura520222/sakura-ai:latest
```

This mode does not include the Host Updater. It can report available releases, but it cannot apply an update from the WebUI.

`latest` always means the stable production channel. Development builds are opt-in from the WebUI Version Manager and require an explicit risk confirmation; updates use the immutable GHCR `dev-...` tag plus manifest digest. `edge` is only a moving development alias and is never persisted as an update target.

After first start, visit `http://localhost:8000/setup`. The app prints a one-time verification token in the startup log; enter it at `/setup/verify` to access the wizard (the token is regenerated on every restart). When `start.sh` waits in the foreground, it displays the current Setup Token immediately after a successful deployment. You can also reopen the main menu and choose **View current container logs** → **Web**:

```bash
# Alternatively, tail the Web container directly from /opt/sakura-ai
docker compose --env-file .deploy/deployment.env --project-name sakura-ai \
  -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f --tail=200 web
```

The main menu's **View previous runtime logs** entry reads persisted DEBUG logs. For error filtering and more see [Deployment Guide · View Runtime Logs](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#八查看运行日志).

### Source Development

> Source-development platforms: Linux x86_64/arm64 with glibc >= 2.28 (non-musl; Alpine is unsupported) or Apple Silicon macOS 14+. Other platforms cannot install the dependencies because upstream onnxruntime ships no Python 3.14 wheel for them (and no sdist); the pip path is limited the same way.

**With uv (recommended)**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sakura520222/Sakura-AI.git
cd Sakura-AI
uv sync                # Creates .venv and installs all dependencies (incl. updater)
uv run python -m backend.main
```

When no deployment mode or image-build marker is present, the `backend.main` launcher automatically identifies its application child as `source`; a local `local` Agent backend does not need a separate `SAKURA_DEPLOY_MODE` setting. An explicit environment value always takes precedence, and image environments are never inferred to be source checkouts.

**Classic pip (without uv)**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e './updater[dev]'
python -m backend.main
```

> In local development, changes under `backend/` are hot-reloaded at module level inside the app subprocess (no process restart); changes to process-level modules such as `backend/main.py` or database models log a hint to restart manually. In-app restart requests (Setup completion, admin restart button) still respawn the whole process via the supervision loop.

> Deployment details (image tags, pinned versions, GitHub App creation, database setup, full Setup Wizard flow, Host Updater daemon, upgrade and password rotation) are in the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) (Chinese).

## Development

```bash
uv sync                              # Install dependencies (uv; classic pip: pip install -r requirements.txt plus pip install -e './updater[dev]')
uv run python -m backend.main        # Start the app (pip envs: python -m backend.main)
python run_ruff.py                   # Lint + fix + format
python run_ruff.py --check           # Read-only check
uv run python -m pytest -q           # Run tests (pip envs: python -m pytest -q)
tail -f "$(ls -t logs/app_*.log | head -n1)"  # Tail latest run log (DEBUG)
```

First launch enters Bootstrap mode — a one-time verification token is printed to the terminal; enter it at `/setup/verify`, then visit `http://localhost:8000/setup` to complete configuration. To debug the Setup Wizard flow, use `py scripts/dev_bootstrap.py` (isolated dev config, skips background tasks).

> Run logs are written to `logs/app_*.log` (one file per startup, 500 MB rotation, 10-day retention; passwords and tokens are auto-redacted). For Docker log-viewing commands see the [Deployment Guide · View Runtime Logs](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#八查看运行日志).

> The Updater is an independent Python 3.14+ package (`updater/`) with its own `pyproject.toml`, tests, and PyInstaller native build chain — see the [updater directory](updater/) for development. Its release binaries are built on Bookworm (glibc 2.36) and require the host to run glibc ≥ 2.36 (Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 24.04+).

## Contributing

This project uses the standard Gitflow workflow: `main` (production) ← `release/*` / `hotfix/*`; `develop` (integration) ← `feature/*`.

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch from `develop`: `git checkout develop && git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Commit changes (English [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)): `git commit -m 'feat: add some amazing feature'`
4. Push and open a Pull Request targeting `develop`

Releases and hotfixes are handled by maintainers: create `release/x.y.z` from `develop` (or `hotfix/x.y.z` from `main`), merge into `main` to auto-publish a Release, then `main` is synced back to `develop`. Automation enforces PR branch flow, runs CI, and cleans up merged temporary branches.
